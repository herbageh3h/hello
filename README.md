# hello: My personal project for learning and reviewing programming language

For a long time, I learned many programming languages and forgot, especially when I don't use this language for a while. When I got back
into this language again, I found I am a completely stranger to it. I have to relearn it from basic and it cost a lot of time. 

Stimulated by the idea of learnxinyminutes.com, if I could get a quickly overview of the core concept and examples, it will be a very effetive
way to grasp the language back. Then I can master several languages. That's the idea of this project.

Like helloworld in any programming language course, I'd like to setup this project name as hello. I will put all material relating to some
language in a big file so that I could walk through the file and be familiar with the concepts.
